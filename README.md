To download all the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

If there is no packages.json file:
```sh
npm init
```

To add a dependency (--save adds to package.json):

```sh
npm install BLAH --save
```

Run the uglify commands:

```sh
grunt uglify
```

If you get a weird permissions error writing to ~/tmp/ you may need to delete that directory and re-run.
